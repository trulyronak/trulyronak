# Welcome to my corner of the internet

*laughs in markdown*

I code too much, spend too much time obsessing over random fandoms (I've currently fallen back into Star Wars), and like to cook (I've finally perfected restaurant style thai fried rice).

I like to talk to new people, and I'm down to chat about anything, so feel free to [hit me up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/trulyronak) or [message me on facebook](https://facebook.com/trulyronak) (if we have mutual friends)

You can find me online generally [@trulyronak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
