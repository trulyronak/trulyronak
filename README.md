# Hello There

![Hello there](https://media.giphy.com/media/Nx0rz3jtxtEre/giphy.gif)

I'm Ronak, a software engineer and entrepreneur from Southern California.

Currently finishing up my degree at the **[University of California at San Diego](https://ucsd.edu)** and preparing to rejoin my amazing friends at [Nearside](https://nearside.com) to help make better financial services for small businesses.

Professionally, I've worked at [**Hatch**](https://hatchcard.com) (as part of the **[Kleiner Perkins Fellowship](https://fellows.kleinerperkins.com/meet-the-fellows/2021)**), [**Gusto**](https://gusto.com), [**Optic (YC 18)**](https://useoptic.com), the [**US Digital Service**](https://usds.gov), and [**Zesty.io**](https://zesty.io).

While in college, I started **[ACM at UCSD](https://acmucsd.com)**, and helped grow it to become the largest student organization on campus. I've also been involved with doing research with **[Niema Moshiri](http://niema.net/)**, and I've also tutored CSE 100 (Advanced Data Structures) for 2 years with him.

If you're a UCSD student, interested in one of my past experiences, or just want to chat, feel free to [email me](mailto:contact@ronakshah.net) or [leave me a note](http://tellmeanything.ronakshah.net).

In my spare time, I love to cook, play video games, read, and of course, code.
