# Hello There

![Hello there](https://media.giphy.com/media/Nx0rz3jtxtEre/giphy.gif)

I'm Ronak, a software engineer and entrepreneur from Southern California.

I'm currently finishing up my senior year at the **[University of California at San Diego](https://ucsd.edu)**.

Recently, I started working with **[Niema Moshiri](http://niema.net/)** on a project to speed up iVar.

I also helped to cofound [**ACM at UC San Diego**](https://acmucsd.com) (I ran sponsorship and created much of the initial structure of the organization), and currently help out as a PM for the [Development Team](https://github.com/acmucsd).

Previously, I've worked at [**Hatch**](https://hatchcard.com) (as part of the **[Kleiner Perkins Fellowship](https://fellows.kleinerperkins.com/meet-the-fellows/2021)**), [**Gusto**](https://gusto.com), [**Optic (YC 18)**](https://useoptic.com), the [**US Digital Service**](https://usds.gov), and [**Zesty.io**](https://zesty.io).

When I graduate, I'm planning on rejoining my amazing friends at **[Hatch](https://hatchcard.com)** to help make better financial services for small businesses.

In my spare time, I love to cook, play video games, hike, and of course, code.
