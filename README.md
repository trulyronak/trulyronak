# Hello There

![Hello there](https://media.giphy.com/media/Nx0rz3jtxtEre/giphy.gif)

I'm Ronak, a software engineer and entrepreneur from Southern California.

Currently a student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) studying Computer Science and minoring in Entrepreneurship and Innovation.

This summer, I'm joining [Gusto](https://gusto.com) in the summer to work on the Growth team, to promote upsell across their different services and improve customer engagement.

Previously, I interned at [Hatch](https://hatchcard.com]), [Optic (YC 18)](https://useoptic.com), the [US Digital Service](https://usds.gov), and [Zesty.io](https://zesty.io).

I also helped to cofound [ACM at UC San Diego](https://acmucsd.com) (I ran sponsorship and created much of the initial structure of the organization), and currently help out as a PM for the [Development Team](https://github.com/acmucsd).
