# Hello There

![Hello there](https://media.giphy.com/media/Nx0rz3jtxtEre/giphy.gif)

I'm Ronak, a software engineer and entrepreneur from Southern California.

I recently graduated from [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) with a BS in Computer Science and am working at [Watershed](https://watershed.com) to help companies reduce their carbon emissions.


Professionally, I've worked at [**Nearside**](https://nearside.com) and [**Gusto**](https://gusto.com) (as part of the **[Kleiner Perkins Fellowship](https://fellows.kleinerperkins.com/meet-the-fellows/2021)**), [**Optic (YC 18)**](https://useoptic.com), the [**US Digital Service**](https://usds.gov) (as part of the **[Civic Digital Fellowship](https://codingitforward.com))**, and [**Zesty.io**](https://zesty.io).

While in college, I started **[ACM at UCSD](https://acmucsd.com)**, and helped grow it to become the largest student organization on campus. I've also been involved with doing research with **[Niema Moshiri](http://niema.net/)**, and I've also tutored CSE 100 (Advanced Data Structures) for 2 years with him.

I'm interested in building technology that empowers others, with specific interests in climate tech, health care, and public policy. I obsess over the customer experience, and want to build products that people *want* to use.

You can contact me via [email](mailto:contact@ronakshah.net) or by [leaving me a note](http://tellmeanything.ronakshah.net).

In my spare time, I love to cook, play video games, read, and of course, code.
